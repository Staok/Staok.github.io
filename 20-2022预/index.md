# Judy Hevenly's 2022 Predictions that for future reference

外网预测相关的博主（如 youtuber——conscience，还有本文这位都自幼有“gift”的主）火了好几波了，外网娱乐 youtuber 老高与小沫在近期视频有提到这些，并提道“毕竟这种能火了好几拨的，说明人家可能真有实力”哈哈。对于这些”预言“，在这里前置的补充一些说法：

- 有的很具体，有的比较模糊；对于很具体的有说：“人家有些预测也是基于广泛的真实有效的信息，相互牵绊和推理来总结，结论是有相互关联的”，对于比较模糊的有说是：“人家看到的东西大抵是比较模糊的画面和预兆，只是去猜这个景象的意思”。
- “说出来可能就不发生了”；但，我提供另一个角度，也有可能有神秘力量、deep state 之流把这些当作“剧本”去执行，然后大部分兑现了...额...我就是说说。

Judy Hevenly (Psychic and spiritual counselor) 的2022预测我挑几个感兴趣的记录在此，备将来查（引用原网址：[2022 Predictions - Judy Hevenly](https://judyhevenly.com/predictions/)）：

1、Covid-19 will make its way out by the end of 2022. Direct impact of COVID-19 and variants will last well into 2023.（意思是整体上来讲，而非所有地方，尤其是呕洲和霉国方向）

2、2022 will be a new world, a re-shaped economy, people will change their long-held beliefs as they adapt to a new society trying to get back to normal. It’s a time to rebuild lives, and a willingness to work hard to see future success and growth. 

3、America’s leader will be able to get things done in the first half of the year but in the second half there are possible health problems for President Biden.

4、Us automakers come out with a crash-avoid brake in 2022. A big fire breaks out in Chicago causing much damage to the city. An electrical power outage in New York City.

6、Boris Johnson could step down, Chancellor Rishi Sunak of the Conservatives, Liz Truss, Foreign Secretary, or Jeremy Hunt, could replace him. A hard Brexit could end UK’s growth in 2022.

6.9、Putin will try to destroy the independent state of Ukraine, and get rid of Nato to cement Russia’s role as rival to the West, United Kingdom will have to choose between gas from Russia or Ukraine and Putin will provoke Ukraine by a show of military power.

7、（这一条就很有趣，接上一条，“彼时彼刻、就是此时此刻”）The Chinese will make their move on Taiwan and US will be helpless because of the debt they owe to China, and it will be disastrous for US and the global economy and everyone will have to adjust to a more difficult relationship with that country.

8、Unexpected illness for Vladimir Putin, and protests, uprising and unrest in in his country.

9、Japan becomes a nuclear weapon nation.（第7条的”代价“？）

10、（神秘的光？还着陆？）New sighting and several landings of unknown lights and objects are observed on and above earth, moon and solar system planets and also in Mexico.

11、The Saudis will move further away from America their security guarantor for military and economic purposes ties with China will become more important.（结合第7条后半句？）

12、关于奥斯卡获奖的预测，这主据说准确率90%以上，我没查证，因此这相关的”94th Academy Awards, March 27, 2022“内容略过。

13、The market for artificial intelligence chips will become more popular including designs by start-ups backed by funders.（这个圈内明眼人都可见）

14、The Chinese space station Tiangong will be fully operational which will include anti-satellite weapons. Blue Origin founded by Jeff Bezos has edge I space exploration; Nasa in US will launch three probes in 2022 to study space rocks between Mars and Jupiter. Elon Musk’s Space X will continue to work towards a permanent base on Mars.（马斯克这个我信，毕竟话早已经放出去了）

15、A rocket ship to be launched to shorten the flight from London to Sydney in Australia in under 3 hours.（以后如果问”你咋来的？“回道”我坐火箭来的“可能不是一句玩笑）

16、Hurricane season reaps havoc for parts of New York city, high tides and storms for Philippines, with wildfires in Canada, and Australia. Flooding in China and Caribbean in Winter of 2022.

 

  

记录在此将来备查，看看疗效，别”嘴上都是主义，心里都是生意“，大概不会吧...乐观对待。
